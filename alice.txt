alice adventures in wonderland

down the rabbit-hole


alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in
it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or
conversations

so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the
day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her

there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh
dear i shall be too late but when the rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice
started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take
out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after
it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under
the hedge in another moment down went alice after it

illustration

the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then
dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
to be a very deep well

either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her first she tried to
make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything
then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were
filled with cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and
pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed it was labeled orange marmalade but to her great
disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar so
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it

down down down would the fall never come to an end there was nothing
else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah miss me
very much to-night i should think dinah was the cat i hope
they remember her saucer of milk at tea-time dinah my dear i wish
you were down here with me alice felt that she was dozing off when
suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry
leaves and the fall was over

alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up
but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and
the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a
moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to
hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late
it getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but
the rabbit was no longer to be seen

she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but
they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side
and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle
wondering how she was ever to get out again

suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid glass there
was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice first idea was that
this might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the
locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it
would not open any of them however on the second time round she came
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a
little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key
in the lock and to her great delight it fitted

illustration

alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not
much larger than a rat-hole she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of
that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the
doorway oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope
i think i could if i only knew how to begin

alice went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on
it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly
was not here before said alice and tied round the neck of the
bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed
on it in large letters

no i look first she said and see whether it marked poison
or not for she had never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle
marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or
later however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured
to taste it and finding it very nice it had a sort of mixed flavor of
cherry-tart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and hot buttered
toast she very soon finished it off

                                   

what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a
telescope

and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden

after awhile finding that nothing more happened she decided on going
into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the
door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she
went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach
it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery
and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing
sat down and cried

come there no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather
sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave
herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and
sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her
eyes

soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table
she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat
me were beautifully marked in currants well i eat it said
alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it
makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way i
get into the garden and i don care which happens

she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which
way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was
growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake

ithe pool of tears


curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was good-by feet oh
my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings
for you now dears i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you

just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall in
fact she was now rather more than nine feet high and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door

poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to
look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more
hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again

she went on shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all
round her and reaching half down the hall

after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white
rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid-gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a
great hurry muttering to himself oh the duchess the duchess oh
won she be savage if ive kept her waiting

when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low timid voice if
you please sir-- the rabbit started violently dropped the white
kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he
could go

illustration

alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the
time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to-day
and yesterday things went on just as usual was i the same when i got
up this morning but if im not the same the next question is who in
the world am i ah that the great puzzle

as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the rabbit little white kid-gloves while
she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be
growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was
going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this
was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to
save herself from shrinking away altogether

that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and
now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door
but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before things are worse than ever
thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before
never

as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment
splash she was up to her chin in salt-water her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea however she soon made out that she
was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high

illustration

just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off and she swam nearer to see what it was she soon made out that it
was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself

would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse
everything is so out-of-the-way down here that i should think very
likely it can talk at any rate there no harm in trying so she
began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired
of swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but
it said nothing

perhaps it doesn understand english thought alice i dare say it
a french mouse come over with william the conqueror so she began
again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french
lesson-book the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to
quiver all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice
hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal feelings i quite
forgot you didn like cats

not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would
you like cats if you were me

well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don be angry
about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear
quiet thing the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it
must be really offended we won talk about her any more if you
rather not

we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of its
tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated
cats--nasty low vulgar things don let me hear the name again

illustration alice at the mad tea party

i won indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation are you--are you fond--of--of dogs there is such a nice
little dog near our house i should like to show you it kills all the
rats and--oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive
offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as
it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went

so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we
won talk about cats or dogs either if you don like them when the
mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face
was quite pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to
the shore and then i tell you my history and you understand why it
is i hate cats and dogs

it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo
a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the
way and the whole party swam to the shore

illustration




iia caucus-race and a long tale


they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close
to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable

illustration

the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a
consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had
known them all her life

at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of some authority among
them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i soon
make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with
the mouse in the middle

ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this
is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william
the conqueror whose cause was favored by the pope was soon submitted
to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of
mercia and northumbria--

ugh said the lory with a shiver

--and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it
advisable--

found what said the duck

found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know
what it means

i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the
duck it generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the
archbishop find

the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on --found
it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the
crown--how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to
alice as it spoke

as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesn seem to
dry me at all

in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that
the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--

speak english said the eaglet i don know the meaning of half
those long words and what more i don believe you do either

what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race

what is a caucus-race said alice

illustration

why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it
marked out a race-course in a sort of circle and then all the party
were placed along the course here and there there was no one two
three and away but they began running when they liked and left off
when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over
however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite
dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they
all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won

this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought
at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes

but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked

why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one
finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in
a confused way prizes prizes

alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand into her
pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt-water had not
got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one
a-piece all round

the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and
confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and
begged the mouse to tell them something more

you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why
it is you hate--c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it
would be offended again

mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and
sighing

it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder
at the mouse tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on
puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the
tale was something like this--

    fury said to
      a mouse that
         he met in the
            house let
              us both go
                to law i
                 will prosecute
               you--
                 come i
              take no denial
             we
           must have
        the trial
     for really
    this morning
    ive
    nothing
    to do
    said the
     mouse to
      the cur
       uch a
        trial dear
           sir with
               no jury
                or judge
                   would
                  be wasting
                our
             breath
         i be
        judge
       i be
      jury
     said
    cunning
    old
     fury
      i
       try
        the
         whole
          cause
          and
         condemn
       you to
    death

you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are
you thinking of

i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth
bend i think

you insult me by talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and
walking away

please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the
others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook
its head impatiently and walked a little quicker

i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a
remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at
once and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children
come away my dears it high time you were all in bed on various
pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone

i wish i hadn mentioned dinah nobody seems to like her down here and
im sure she the best cat in the world poor alice began to cry
again for she felt very lonely and low-spirited in a little while
however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance
and she looked up eagerly

the rabbit sends in a little bill


it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking
anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it
muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my
fur and whiskers she get me executed as sure as ferrets are
ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door
had vanished completely

very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her in an angry tone
why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and
fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now

he took me for his housemaid said alice as she ran off how
surprised he be when he finds out who i am as she said this she
came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without
knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the
real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves

by this time alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a
table in the window and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny
white kid-gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was
just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle
that stood near the looking-glass she uncorked it and put it to her
lips saying to herself i do hope it make me grow large again for
really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing

before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing
against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that quite
enough--i hope i shan grow any more

alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and
very soon she had to kneel down on the floor still she went on growing
and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot
up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever
happens what will become of me

illustration

luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
and she grew no larger after a few minutes she heard a voice outside
and stopped to listen

mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was
the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the
house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it

presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as
the door opened inwards and alice elbow was pressed hard against it
that attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then i
go round and get in at the window

that you won thought alice and after waiting till she fancied
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her
hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything
but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame or something of that sort

next came an angry voice--the rabbit--pat pat where are you and
then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging
for apples yer honor

here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what that in
the window

sure it an arm yer honor

well it got no business there at any rate go and take it away

there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers
now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and made another
snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass i wonder what they do next thought alice
as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could

she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a
rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together she made out the words where the other ladder
bill got the other--bill here bill will the roof bear--who to go
down the chimney--nay i shan you do it here bill the master
says youve got to go down the chimney

alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till
she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney
close above her then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what
would happen next

the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill
then the rabbit voice alone--catch him you by the hedge then
silence and then another confusion of voices--hold up his head--brandy
now--don choke him--what happened to you

last came a little feeble squeaking voice well i hardly know--no
more thank ye im better now--all i know is something comes at me
like a jack-in-the-box and up i goes like a sky-rocket

after a minute or two of silence they began moving about again and
alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with

a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window and some of them hit her in the face alice noticed with some
surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they
lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of
these cakes she thought it sure to make some change in my size

so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through
the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside they all made a rush at alice the
moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found
herself safe in a thick wood

illustration the duchess tucked her arm affectionately into
alice

the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i
ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is
what

alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass but
she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or
drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near
her about the same height as herself she stretched herself up on
tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a
large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms
folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else

illustration




advice from a caterpillar


at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed
alice in a languid sleepy voice

who are you said the caterpillar

illustration

alice replied rather shyly i hardly know sir just at present--at
least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must
have changed several times since then

what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain
yourself

i can explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im
not myself you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very
confusing she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you
ought to tell me who you are first

why said the caterpillar

as alice could not think of any good reason and the caterpillar seemed
to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away

come back the caterpillar called after her ive something important
to say alice turned and came back again

keep your temper said the caterpillar

is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she
could

no said the caterpillar

it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said
so you think youre changed do you

im afraid i am sir said alice i can remember things as i
used--and i don keep the same size for ten minutes together

what size do you want to be asked the caterpillar

oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one
doesn like changing so often you know i should like to be a little
larger sir if you wouldn mind said alice three inches is such a
wretched height to be

it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high

in a minute or two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and
crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it went one side
will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow
shorter

one side of what the other side of what thought alice to
herself

of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it
aloud and in another moment it was out of sight

alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying
to make out which were the two sides of it at last she stretched her
arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge
with each hand

and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot

she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as she was
shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other
bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to
swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit

come my head free at last said alice but all she could see when
she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her

where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i
can see you she was delighted to find that her neck would bend
about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in
curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among
the leaves when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large
pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its
wings

illustration

serpent cried the pigeon

im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone

ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried
hedges the pigeon went on but those serpents there no pleasing
them

alice was more and more puzzled

as if it wasn trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon
but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and day and just as
i taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising
its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of
them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh
serpent

but im not a serpent i tell you said alice im a--im a--im a
little girl she added rather doubtfully as she remembered the number
of changes she had gone through that day

youre looking for eggs i know that well enough said the pigeon
and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a
serpent

it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not
looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn want
yours--i don like them raw

well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled
down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after awhile she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and
she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the
other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height

it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it
felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that
beautiful garden--how is that to be done i wonder as she said this
she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about
four feet high whoever lives there thought alice it never do to
come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their
wits she did not venture to go near the house till she had brought
herself down to nine inches high




vpig and pepper


for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a
footman in livery came running out of the wood judging by his face
only she would have called him a fish--and rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a
round face and large eyes like a frog

illustration

the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter
and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the
duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the
frog-footman repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an
invitation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low
and their curls got entangled together

when alice next peeped out the fish-footman was gone and the other was
sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked

there no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for
two reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you are
secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could
possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then
a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces

how am i to get in asked alice

are you to get in at all said the footman that the first
question you know

alice opened the door and went in the door led right into a large
kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess
was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the
cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large caldron which seemed to
be full of soup

there certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself
as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess sneezed
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment pause the only two creatures in the
kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was
grinning from ear to ear

please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat
grins like that

it a cheshire-cat said the duchess and that why

i didn know that cheshire-cats always grinned in fact i didn know
that cats could grin said alice

you don know much said the duchess and that a fact

just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once
set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the
baby--the fire-irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans
plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they
hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite
impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not

oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down
in an agony of terror

here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice
flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play
croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room

alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer-shaped
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions if i
don take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to
kill it in a day or two wouldn it be murder to leave it behind she
said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply

if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice i have
nothing more to do with you mind now

alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with
this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently
that alice looked down into its face in some alarm this time there
could be no mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood

alice was a little startled by seeing the cheshire-cat sitting on a
bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only grinned when it saw her
cheshire-puss began alice rather timidly would you please tell me
which way i ought to go from here

in that direction the cat said waving the right paw round lives
a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march
hare visit either you like theyre both mad

but i don want to go among mad people alice remarked

oh you can help that said the cat were all mad here do you
play croquet with the queen to-day

i should like it very much said alice but i haven been invited
yet

you see me there said the cat and vanished

alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the march hare it was so large a house that she did not like to go near
till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom




via mad tea-party


there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the
march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting
between them fast asleep

the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice
coming there plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table

the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said
was why is a raven like a writing-desk

im glad theyve begun asking riddles--i believe i can guess that she
added aloud

do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the
march hare

exactly so said alice

then you should say what you mean the march hare went on

i do alice hastily replied at least--at least i mean what i
say--that the same thing you know

you might just as well say added the dormouse which seemed to be
talking in its sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing
as i sleep when i breathe

it is the same thing with you said the hatter and he poured a
little hot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently
and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i
was going to remark myself

illustration

have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice
again

no i give it up alice replied what the answer

i haven the slightest idea said the hatter

nor i said the march hare

alice gave a weary sigh i think you might do something better with the
time she said than wasting it in asking riddles that have no
answers

take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly

ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can
take more

you mean you can take less said the hatter it very easy to
take more than nothing

at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly
and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she
looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were
trying to put the dormouse into the tea-pot

illustration the trial of the knave of hearts

at any rate i never go there again said alice as she picked
her way through the wood it the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in
all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees
had a door leading right into it that very curious she thought i
think i may as well go in at once and in she went

once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little
glass table taking the little golden key she unlocked the door that
led into the garden then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high
then she walked down the little passage and then--she found herself
at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower-beds and the
cool fountains




viithe queen croquet ground


a large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses
growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily
painting them red suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon alice as
she stood watching them would you tell me please said alice a
little timidly why you are painting those roses

five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low
voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a
red rose-tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen
was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so
you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to-- at this
moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called
out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps
and alice looked round eager to see the queen

first came ten soldiers carrying clubs with their hands and feet at the
corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with
diamonds after these came the royal children there were ten of them
all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and
queens and among them alice recognized the white rabbit then followed
the knave of hearts carrying the king crown on a crimson velvet
cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and the
queen of hearts

when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked
at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the
knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply

my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely
but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after
all

can you play croquet shouted the queen the question was evidently
meant for alice

yes said alice loudly

come on then roared the queen

it--it a very fine day said a timid voice to alice she was
walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face

very said alice where the duchess

hush hush said the rabbit she under sentence of execution

what for said alice

she boxed the queen ears-- the rabbit began

get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and
people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each
other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game
began

alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her
life it was all ridges and furrows the croquet balls were live
hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and stand on their hands and feet to make the arches

the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling
all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time
the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting
off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute

theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here thought alice the
great wonder is that there anyone left alive

she was looking about for some way of escape when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air it the cheshire-cat she said to herself
now i shall have somebody to talk to

how are you getting on said the cat

i don think they play at all fairly alice said in a rather
complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can hear
oneself speak--and they don seem to have any rules in particular

how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice

not at all said alice

illustration

alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going
on so she went off in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged
in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent
opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only
difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of
the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way
to fly up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away under
her arm that it might not escape again

just then alice ran across the duchess who was now out of prison she
tucked her arm affectionately into alice and they walked off together
alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper she was a
little startled however when she heard the voice of the duchess close
to her ear youre thinking about something my dear and that makes
you forget to talk

the game going on rather better now alice said by way of keeping
up the conversation a little

is so said the duchess and the moral of that is--oh is love
is love that makes the world go round

somebody said alice whispered that it done by everybody minding
his own business

ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her
sharp little chin into alice shoulder as she added and the moral of
that is--ake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of
themselves

to alice great surprise the duchess arm that was linked into hers
began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of
them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm

now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the
ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in
about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and
was gone in a moment

let go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too
much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground

all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarreling with
the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her
head by the end of half an hour or so all the players except the
king the queen and alice were in custody of the soldiers and under
sentence of execution

then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with
alice

alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you
are all pardoned

suddenly the cry the trial beginning was heard in the distance and
alice ran along with the others




ix--who stole the tarts


the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was
standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard
him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand
and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court
was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it i wish they get the
trial done alice thought and hand round the refreshments

the judge by the way was the king and he wore his crown over his great
wig that the jury-box thought alice and those twelve creatures
some were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors

just then the white rabbit cried out silence in the court

herald read the accusation said the king

illustration

on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet then
unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows

    the queen of hearts she made some tarts
      all on a summer day
    the knave of hearts he stole those tarts
      and took them quite away

call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness

the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread and butter in the other

you ought to have finished said the king when did you begin

the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the
court arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it
was he said

give your evidence said the king and don be nervous or i have
you executed on the spot

this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from
one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread
and butter

just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation--she was
beginning to grow larger again

the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went
down on one knee im a poor man your majesty he began

youre a very poor speaker said the king

you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court

call the next witness said the king

the next witness was the duchess cook she carried the pepper-box in
her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once

give your evidence said the king

shan said the cook

the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice
your majesty must cross-examine this witness

well if i must i must the king said what are tarts made of

pepper mostly said the cook

for some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they
had settled down again the cook had disappeared

never mind said the king call the next witness

alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list imagine her
surprise when he read out at the top of his shrill little voice the
name alice




x--alice evidence


here cried alice she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over
the jury-box upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd
below

oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay

the trial cannot proceed said the king until all the jurymen are
back in their proper places--all he repeated with great emphasis
looking hard at alice

what do you know about this business the king said to alice

nothing whatever said alice

the king then read from his book rule forty-two all persons more
than a mile high to leave the court

im not a mile high said alice

nearly two miles high said the queen

illustration

well i shan go at any rate said alice

the king turned pale and shut his note-book hastily consider your
verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice

there more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white
rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked
up it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody he
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn a letter after all
it a set of verses

please your majesty said the knave i didn write it and they
can prove that i did there no name signed at the end

you must have meant some mischief or else you have signed your
name like an honest man said the king there was a general clapping of
hands at this

read them he added turning to the white rabbit

there was dead silence in the court whilst the white rabbit read out the
verses

that the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the
king

i don believe there an atom of meaning in it ventured alice

if there no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of
trouble you know as we needn try to find any let the jury consider
their verdict

no no said the queen sentence first--verdict afterwards

stuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the
sentence first

hold your tongue said the queen turning purple

i won said alice

off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody
moved

who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by
this time youre nothing but a pack of cards

illustration

at this the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and
tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her
head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face

wake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep youve
had

oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her
sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about alice got up and ran off
thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had
been

section 4  information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  many small donations
$1 to $5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states  compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  to
send donations or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http//pglaforg

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states  us laws alone swamp our small staff

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
to donate please visit http//pglaforg/donate
